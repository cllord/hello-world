hi there - I'm practicing up on java but what I REALLY want to do is spend time on R
and after that I want to learn Python
so many projects, so little time !

I work for IBM and study information science at UVIC

I had a fun day today teaching girls that code at a middle school for a STEM outreach
amazing how some girls grasp it so fast - they had fun with Watson analytics
